# Professional README Generator

  ## Description

  This application dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input into the command line. This helps to save the user time and make sure they include all of the information required for a good README. Building this application provided a great opportunity to implement everything I have learned this week about node and ES6. I particularly enjoyed learning about module.exports and putting it into practice with this project.

  Here is a link to the deployed application:
